       The  ASxxxx  assemblers are a series of microprocessor assemblers
    written in the C programming  language.   This  collection  contains
    cross  assemblers  for  the  1802, S2650, 4040(4004), SC/MP, MPS430,
    6100, 61860, 6500, 6800(6802/6808), 6801(6803/HD6303),  6804,  6805,
    68HC(S)08,  6809,  68HC11, 68HC(S)12, 68HC16, 68CF, 68K, 740, 78K/0,
    78K/0S, 8008, 8008S, 8048(8041/8022/8021), 8051, 8085(8080), AT89LP,
    8X300(8X305),  COP4,  COP8,  DS8XCXXX,  AVR,  EZ8,  EZ80, F2MC8L/FX,
    F8/3870, GameBoy(Z80), H8/3xx, Cypress PSoC(M8C), PDP11, PIC, Rabbit
    2000/3000,  RS08,  ST6,  ST7,  ST8,  SX,  Z8, Z80(HD64180), and Z280
    series microprocessors.  The companion program ASLINK is a  relocat-
    ing  linker  supporting  all the cross assemblers.  ASLINK also sup-
    ports object files created with the 4.xx and 3.xx assemblers.  

       The assemblers and linker have been tested using Linux and DJGPP,
    Cygwin, Symantec C/C++  V7.2,  Borland  Turbo C++ 3.0,  Open  Watcom
    V1.9,  VC6,  Visual  Studio  2005,  2010, 2013, 2015, 2019 and 2022.
    Complete source code and documentation for the assemblers and linker
    is included with the distribution.  Additionally, test code for each
    assembler and several microprocessor monitors  (  ASSIST05  for  the
    6805,  MONDEB  and  ASSIST09 for the 6809, BUFFALO 2.5 for the 6811,
    and MONDEB for 8051 / AT89LP series ) are included as working  exam-
    ples of use of these assemblers.

        MS-DOS:
        Windows:        unzip asxv5p50.zip
                        pkunzip -d asxv5p50.zip
                        unzips and restores directory structure
    
        Linux:          unzip -L -a asxv5p50.zip
                        unzips to lower-case names and converts
                        ascii files to \n from \r\n form.
